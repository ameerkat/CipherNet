# CipherNet
## Abstract
CipherNet is a library of classical cryptography techniques, for the .NET framework. 
The aim of CipherNet is simplify composition and searching over the keyspace for a given technique to enable automated search and plaintext retrieval.
CipherNet includes implementations of classical cryptographic algorithms and a framework/tools for search including english language detection.
